  <description lang="en_US">NAO connects automatically to the Open Roberta Lab to receive and execute user programs developed with the visual NEPO programming language via "drag'n drop".

How it works

This app is working in the background. Each time you start NAO the Open Roberta Lab Connector sends its token to the Open Roberta Lab and waits for the NEPO program, provided by the Open Roberta Lab Server to execute it immediately.

The token consists of the last 8 characters of the MAC address. Please press one of NAO's head sensors and it will spell out the token for you.

Once you now the token, go to the Open Roberta Lab, choose NAO as your system, click on the robot's icon in the menu, choose »connect ...« and type in the token in the token field. After confirming the input by clicking »OK« your NAO is connected to the Open Roberta Lab.

Now you can start developing programs with NEPO and execute them immediately on NAO. Have fun programming your NAO with NEPO in the Open Roberta Lab :-)
