  <description lang="en_US">NAO connects automatically to the Open Roberta Lab to receive and execute user programs developed with the visual NEPO programming language via "drag'n drop".

How it works
This app is working in the background. Once NAO has started, he connects automatically to the Open Roberta Lab and waits for a NEPO program. To connect your NAO to your programming session in the Open Roberta Lab, you have to provide a token which belongs to your NAO.
Please press one of NAO's head sensors and it will spell out the token for you. The token consists of a combination of 8 letters and numbers, they are unique for each NAO and you may want to write them down.
Once you know the token, go to the Open Roberta Lab, choose NAO as your system, click on the robot's icon in the menu, choose »connect ...« and type the token into the token field. After confirming the input by clicking »OK«, your NAO is connected to the Open Roberta Lab.
Now you can start developing programs with NEPO and execute them immediately on your NAO. Have fun programming NAO with NEPO in the Open Roberta Lab :-)

For more information please have a look into the Open Roberta Wiki.</description>
